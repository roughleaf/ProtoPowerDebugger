# ProtoPowerDebugger
Small interface application to test, debug and calibrate my power debugger.

The program received raw ADC values through a serial communications port and updated the values on the screen.
This is usefull for me to create an y = mx + b formula to calculate measured current and voltage using the raw ADC values.
I found that using the y = mx + b method yeilds more accurate results than multiplying the ADC value with a constant.
